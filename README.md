## Overview: 

Employee Database analysis to help Bobby determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then Bobby must summarise the analysis and help prepare for “Silver tsunami” for many current employees who are reaching their retirement age.

## Results:

### The number of retiring employees by Title:

- Retirement Titles table which holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955
